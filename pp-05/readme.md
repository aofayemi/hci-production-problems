## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://screenster.io/manual-testing-checklist/

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Forms testing for all pages. To make sure it allows values for data field and input data validity.
2. Navigation testing. Test how users use buttons, links and boxes.
