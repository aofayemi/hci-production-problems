1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13R0u0krnLv85xtOhnvtgdhcUg3
Your Rationale: I chose blue because in popular video games, blue is very common so i think it will be attractive. I chose this based on the Super Mario background color. The original PS4 box is also blue so i think that the color i chose get along other video games console/games.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51T0L0kzxzZw5oWNRnmqsnxrCOL
Your Rationale: In spring time, most of the colors you see are green, yellow and red. The green trees are not so green as it looks like it is starving from sunlight so it is not leaf green. The yellow flowers looks faded like they need more sunlight to be ripe. You know the trees are going to be really beautiful in a few weeks when they get enough sunlight.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31T0+0kY2++sigmPynksynuwY+Z
Your Rationale: Kids like flashy things. Yellow is one of the most popular colors in Cartoon network along with blue. The colors will grab the kids attention and make them interested in the app and learning what it has to offer.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a3w2O0khLxB7t-t6Uqj1-wYh0ye
Your Rationale: I feel like cybersecurity courses are known for it light blue color with padlock in the front page of it. The complementary green is for terminal binary of ones and zeros showing on the computer screen. I feel like this would be the ideal color because we as a society are accustomed to viewing cybersecurity fields in this color.
