## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/navigation-bars/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: To make the navigation bar not to be too cluster, I moved down the promocode to the bottom of the membership page since the only time the promocode is useful is when a user wants to signup for a membership for the Museum as it should not be seen throughout the page.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Color can be used to call attention to the current page that a user is. For example, on the navigation bar to select membership page, there are no differences between the membership and other pages. Also  I would remove the annoying lines in the background because it may affect some  people's eve vision. 

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The current page has no background tint which may help some users know the current page they are on. To make people know where they are in in the website, I decided to add background tint to the membership and page and grid.
